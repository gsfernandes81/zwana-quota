"""Pretty one-screen data-quota readout for a Termux home-screen widget.

Wraps :mod:`zwana_quota` and adds the three things a widget needs that a CLI
does not:

* **Local time.** The portal thinks and reports in UTC; the daily allowance
  lands at 00:00 UTC (observed 00:02). Shown here in the device's own zone.
* **A cache.** A widget can be tapped or refreshed repeatedly, so a fresh answer
  is reused for ``--max-age`` seconds. The portal is the vessel's own captive
  portal and is not metered, so this is about latency and not hammering the
  endpoint rather than about quota — hence a short window.
* **Graceful offline.** If the portal cannot be reached, the last known figures
  are drawn with their age instead of an error page.

Colour is emitted only when stdout is a terminal, so piping this into a widget
that renders plain text gives clean output with no escape-code litter.

Usage::

    python3 quota_widget.py              # the tile: data left, big, plus the reset
    python3 quota_widget.py --full       # the detailed box: bar, top-up, reserve
    python3 quota_widget.py --refresh    # ignore the cache
    python3 quota_widget.py --plain      # never colour
    python3 quota_widget.py --line       # single line, for a status bar
    python3 quota_widget.py --json       # the derived figures, for other scripts

The pipeline is three separable steps, so a caller can stop at whichever one it
needs: :func:`gather` reads the portal, :func:`derive` turns that into the
documented figures, and :func:`render` draws them. ``--json`` prints the middle
step verbatim.

A note for anything gating a download on this: ``free.left_bytes`` is an **upper
bound**, never a floor. Every term that can be wrong — unobserved carried-over
paid data, the portal's accounting lag, a stale cached reading — pushes it the
same way, so treat it as the most free data you could possibly have left.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The Quick Settings tile: two strings, a state and a level
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# A Quick Settings tile is not a small widget, and the face above does not
# shrink into one. Android gives it a label, a subtitle, an icon and a state
# (ACTIVE draws it lit, INACTIVE dim), and nothing else — no rows to lay out, no
# monospace to align, and no way to redraw it except by running something. So
# this composition answers a different question: of everything the box says,
# which two phrases survive being the only two?
#
# The label is the figure, because that is what the tile is for. The subtitle is
# a ladder, and what it keeps at each rung is the rule worth pinning: the reset
# time, which is the one fact on the face that cannot be worked out from the
# rest of it — except when the reading is stale or the portal is offline, which
# means the figure overstates what is left, and then saying so outranks
# everything, exactly as it does on the tile face.
#
# The widths are character budgets against a *proportional* font, so they are
# approximations rather than the measured cell counts :data:`TILE` is. That is
# why they are conservative, why every ladder ends in something very short, and
# why ``--qs-width`` exists: set the tile to a ruler once (``--qs-width 99 99``
# with a known string) and read off where the launcher clips it.

#: Characters the tile's label and subtitle get. One UI clips both without a
#: word, and a clipped subtitle is usually the reset time that got clipped.
QS_LABEL = 10
QS_STATUS = 16

#: Budgets for a tile whose size is the *user's* choice rather than the
#: system's. One UI 8.5 lets a tile be dragged to a different size in the
#: panel, and nothing tells the app which size was picked — there is no
#: callback, no configuration change, nothing to read. So the size is a setting
#: here too: pick the preset matching the tile you dragged out, or measure your
#: own with ``--qs-probe`` and set ``--qs-width``.
#:
#: ``small`` has a status of zero, which means *this tile has no subtitle*
#: rather than "fit the subtitle into nothing". It is the one size that cannot
#: carry the reset time, and that is a real loss rather than a tidier layout:
#: what survives is the figure and the level the icon draws. Choosing it is
#: choosing that, which is why it is named and documented rather than reached
#: by setting the width to something small and seeing what happens.
QS_SIZES = {
    "small": (5, 0),
    "medium": (QS_LABEL, QS_STATUS),
    "large": (12, 34),

#: What the fourth line can say: a word for the icon to follow, since an icon is
#: the one part of the tile that no amount of text budget buys back.
QS_LEVELS = {"1;32": "ok", "1;33": "low", "1;31": "critical"}

#: The tile with no reading behind it at all. Four lines like any other answer,
#: because the caller splits on newlines and a short answer would leave the
#: label of a *previous* run standing beside this run's subtitle.
#:
#: The state is still one of the two ordinary ones, deliberately. Android has a
#: third, ``UNAVAILABLE``, which greys the tile out and stops it being tapped —
#: and a tap is how this one recovers, so a portal that was down when the tile
#: last ran would leave no way to ask it again. The level says ``unknown``
#: instead, where it costs an icon rather than the way out.

    One screenshot of this answers three questions at once: how many columns
    the tile shows, how many rows, and which glyphs are one cell wide (which
    test lines end flush with the ASCII ones).

    Reading the first two off the picture needs one correction each. The ruler
    is longer than any tile, so it wraps, and the column count is the width of
    its *first* visual row — the ``01`` prefix included — which the wrapped rows
    then confirm. Those extra rows are real rows, so the height is two more than
    the last test number you can read whole, not the number itself.

    The environment, argv and parent process are written to :data:`PROBE_LOG`
    so it can also be read back over the shell — that is what reveals whether
    the launcher hands us a pty or any geometry at all.
